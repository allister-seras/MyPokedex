# MyPokedex
As a pokemon trainer, I want to be able to build my own team and have access to the Pokedex anywhere. With this application, I would be able to strategically build a Pokemon team and access all the necessary data to build an ideal team that will give me a competitive edge over other Pokemon Trainers!
